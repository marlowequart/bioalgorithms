These scripts are various scripts I have created for solving challenges on Rosalind.info

base_filter_by_quality.py is a script to filter a FASTQ file, removing leading and trailing bases with quality scores below a given threshold.

base_quality_dist.py is a script that returns the number of positions in a FASTQ file where the mean base quality falls below a given threshold.
